There is almost certainly no migration needed...

=========================================================
CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================

(1) Missing "traffic" or "usecase" files
========================================
Both of these files are expected to be regenerated, either by TextTest itself ("traffic") or
your GUI simulation tool of choice ("usecase"). But previously TextTest has never complained
if they have not been regenerated.

This is now changed, so on running TextTest 3.14 you might get a load of tests reporting
"missing traffic" or "missing usecase" that have worked previously.

In all probability the files in question were simply not used before and can safely be removed. 
If however they were needed but are not regenerated for some reason, you can restore the old 
handling via the following in your config file.

# Don't complain if the traffic file is missing...
[definition_file_stems]
regenerate:{CLEAR traffic}
builtin:traffic
[end]

Obviously you can swap "traffic" for "usecase" if appropriate.
