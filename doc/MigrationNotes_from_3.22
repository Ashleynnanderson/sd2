CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================

(1) Known bugs no longer "fail the whole run"
=============================================
TextTest returns an exit code of 1 if any tests fail. It no longer does this for "known bugs": it reckons they
are under control and not a reason to fail things.
