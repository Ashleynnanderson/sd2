There is almost certainly no migration needed. But a few things in TextTest 3.13
will be different from 3.12 by default. This is worth a quick scan in case any of
this applies to you.

=========================================================
CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================

(1) The HTML historical batch report now looks a bit different by default
=========================================================================
Instead of generating an "All" page it will generate one page per month. The basic point is
to speed up generation of the pages once there is lots of data, as the older pages won't need
to be regenerated. Also to avoid creating a huge All page that the browser can't really handle.

If you really miss your All page the behaviour from 3.12 can be restored by setting the config
file setting "historical_report_all_page" to "true".

(2) import_config_file now behaves like "import" in Python or #include in C
===========================================================================
The basic effect is that it is exactly equivalent to pasting the contents of the imported file into your 
config file at that point.

Obviously this isn't guaranteed to behave the same as in version 3.12, where settings in the config file always
had priority over those in the imported file. Now it depends on where the file is imported which setting will be
used.

It's obviously more flexible (imported files can import other files, for example) and should be more
intuitive but it's possible your config files aren't back-compatible.
 
(3) Extra syntax checking on your config file
=============================================
It's possible you may get warnings/popups which you didn't get before. But hopefully you
will deserve them... in particular mistakenly missing [end] markers will create warnings now.

(4) TextTest's default location for its internal logging is now ~/.texttest/log
===============================================================================
Instead of $TEXTTEST_HOME/Diagnostics. But it is still configurable as before. The configuration file
lives with the source in the log subdirectory and should probably be copied to the above location
and edited as desired if you need to debug TextTest this way.
